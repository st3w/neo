neo works with Linux, and it should work with other POSIX-compliant
operating systems such as macOS and FreeBSD. Windows is not supported.

The following packages are required to build and run neo:

- autoconf: neo is built using autotools
- autoconf-archive: required for some of the autoconf checks
- build-essential: make and g++ are used for compilation
- libncurses-dev: neo uses ncursesw to control the terminal

You will need to ensure that your C++ compiler supports C++11 and that
your autoconf version is at least 2.61. g++ and clang should both work
for compilation.

To build neo, run the following shell commands from the main directory:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install


For developers, the original author strongly recommends creating a "build"
directory and running most of the steps from there. The reason is that
autotools may clutter the "src" directory with build artifacts otherwise.
The .gitignore might not be ignoring everything that it needs to...

./autogen.sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
make clean make -j3
sudo make install


If you wish to work on neo or debug it, the following configure options
may help:

./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O0 -Wall -Werror'


Here is a build recipe for users who want a smaller install size.
In the original author's experience, clang++ produces a slightly smaller
executable for neo.

./configure CXXFLAGS="-Os -march=native -mtune=native -DNDEBUG -fno-exceptions -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -flto" LDFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections -flto" CXX="clang++"
make -j3
sudo make install-strip
